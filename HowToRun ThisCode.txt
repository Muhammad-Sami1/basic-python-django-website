Step#1:
I have created the requirements.txt  along with the source code so just run the following 
command to get all the required files to run our website code. After openeing the source code 
folder in editor like VS-Code run the following command in the terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(The major thing in it is the framework we have used which is Django 3.2.3)

Now enter the following command in the terminal:

python manage.py runserver

after entering this command a local server will be created and the link of it will be displayed
